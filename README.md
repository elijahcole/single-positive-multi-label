# Multi-Label Learning from Single Positive Labels

Code to reproduce the main results in the paper [Multi-Label Learning from Single Positive Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09708) (CVPR 2021). 

## Getting Started

See the `README.md` file in the `data` directory for instructions on downloading and setting up the datasets.

## Training a Model

To train and evaluate a model, run:
```
python train.py
```

## Selecting the Training Procedure
To generate different entries of the main table, modify the following parameters:
1. `dataset`: Which dataset to use.
1. `loss`: Which loss to use.
1. `train_mode`: Whether to (a) train a linear classifier on top of pre-extracted features, (b) train end-to-end, or (c) do (a) followed by (b).
1. `val_set_variant`: Whether to use a clean val set or a validation set where a single positive is observed for each image.

## Hyperparameter Search
As written, `train.py` will run a hyperparameter search over a few different learning rates and batch sizes, save the results for all runs, and report the best run. If desired, modify the code at the bottom of `train.py` to search over different parameter settings. 

**The `linear_init` mode searches over hyperparameters for the fine-tuning phase only.** The hyperparameters for the linear training phase are fixed. In particular, `linear_init_lr` and `linear_init_bsize` are set to the best learning rate and batch size from a `linear_fixed_features` hyperparameter search. 

## Misc
* The `requirements.txt` files was generated using the wonderful tool [pipreqs](https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs).
* Please feel free to get in touch / open an issue if anything is unclear. 
* In this paper we used only those images from NUSWIDE which were still publicly available when we re-crawled the dataset in 2020 using Namhyuk Ahn's [downloader](https://github.com/nmhkahn/NUS-WIDE-downloader). Following the instructions in `data/README.md` should yield the exact subset used for our experiments.
